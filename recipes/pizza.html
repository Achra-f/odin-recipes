    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup blanched almond flour</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons no-sugar added pizza sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>5 slices pepperoni</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place an oven rack in top position. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the crust: In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the mozzarella cheese, almond flour, garlic powder, and
            salt and stir until well blended. Microwave for 25 seconds.
        </li>

        <li>
            Knead the dough with your hands for a few seconds. Add the egg yolk while the dough is still warm. Knead
            until combined and roll into a ball. Form a disk as if you were making a hamburger patty. Place the dough on
            a parchment-lined baking sheet and use your hands to press into a circle 5 to 6 inches in diameter and about
            ¼ inch thick (or use a rolling pin). If the dough cools too much for form properly, place it back in the
            microwave for 10 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a fork to poke holes in several places throughout the crust before baking. Bake on the top rack for 8 to
            10 minutes, until the crust is golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the crust from the oven and flip it over. Top the flatter side with the pizza sauce and sprinkle with
            half of the cheese. Next, add the pepperoni slices, then sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake for
            another 3 to 4 minutes, until the cheese is melted.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle the pizza with Italian seasoning before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
